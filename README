INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Ensure that MySQL is installed.  Set up database, username,
and password. Create .my.cnf with that info.
Download swt.tar.gz.
  tar zxf swt.tar.gz  
It creates directory install-swt.
Install install-swt/expandfile in your $PATH.
Install thvve.pm in your $PERL5LIB.

Run the configure script by doing
  cd install-swt
  ./configure

It will ask for the following:
- where to install the code
- where to write temporary data
- name of the SQL database
- SQL database server domain address
- SQL database username
- SQL database password
- Report title
- directory where the output files will be moved
- directory where config file is kept
- Your domain name
- path to mysql
- path to mysqldump
- daily log file or running log file
- do reverse DNS?
- do GEOIP?
- where ISP puts log file
- where to put bad logfiles
- where to put processed logfiles

It will test that things are installed and that the database
is working.  It will then build configuration files in
swt-install.

When configuration is done and satisfactory, do
  ./install

It will move swt, *.htmt, *.htmi, *.sql, *.sh to the program dir
It will move swtconfig.htmi to the config file dir
It will move mys, mysqlload and mysqldumpcum to the program dir
It will move all the gifs (one pixel stuff) to the report dir
It will move all the Java class files to the report dir
It will copy swtstyle.css and swt.js to the report dir.

If this is a new install it will ask whether to init the database.

The installer generates a cron job to run Super Webtrax
every night and to move the output files to your web
statistics display directory. This job may require hand
editing.  Because jobs started by cron do not execute your
shell startup, you must take special steps to ensure that
your $PATH, $PERL5LIB, and other shell variables are
correctly set.

If you are doing GeoIP processing, download GeoIPcity.dat
from http://www.maxmind.com/ and install
it in ~/lib, link as GeoIPCity.dat, link it into $DATADIR.
Ensure that Geo::IP::PurePerl is installed on the Perl path.

Tailor swt-user.sql as needed.
